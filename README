JanrainEngage (http://www.janrain.com/products/engage) is an SSO utility.
Hooking it into a MediaWiki extension, it becomes possible to use Facebook,
OpenID, Google, etc., to sign on in MediaWiki instances.

To add this extension to MediaWiki, just add one line to the bottom of
LocalSettings.php:

require_once('extensions/JanrainEngage/JanrainEngage.php');

and copy all these files into the extensions directory in a folder called
JanrainEngage.  You will also need an API key for Janrain so that it will
accept tokens from your website.  It is free to sign up!
